Welcome to the **RealCloud Logo Studies**, a simple sketch developed with [Processing](http://processing.org/) while designing the logo for our middleware application targeting Cloud Video Streaming.

### Requirements

Developed on Processing Processing 1.5.

### How to use it

Simply run the sketch and adjust the various parameters you'll find on top (i.e. text, colours, font, and so on) to see it changing.

### Special thanks and contributors

**InSideOut10 Logo Generator** is an *Open Source* software started as an initiative of [InsideOut10](http://www.insideout.io) and based on the original artwork of [Ricard Marxer Pi침칩n](http://www.ricardmarxer.com) that we would like to thank for creating the original sketch.

Logo is not going to be used commercially but we had a lot of fun playing with the Geomerative Library.
